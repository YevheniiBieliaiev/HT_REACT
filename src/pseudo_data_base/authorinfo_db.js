  "details_block_1": "is a thrash metal band from Russia, founded in 1987 by former members of Aria. In 1987, Alik Granovsky, Andrey Bolshakov, Kirill Pokrovsky, and Igor Molchanov left the heavy metal band Aria due to their conflict with the producer Victor Vekshtein. Vocalist Mikhail Seryshev and guitarist Sergey Popov joined them to play live concerts. Their first self-titled release was half-completed by Aria's songs written by Granovsky and Bolshakov, but the rest of the songs were completely different in style. Master turned away from Aria's NWOBHM-like style to speed/thrash metal. The second album showcased this change, featuring hard aggressive riffs and fast tempos.",

  "current": "Alik Granovsky — bass, guitar, keyboards (1987—present), Leo Fomin — guitar (1998—2000, 2008—present), Lexx KravchenKo — lead vocals (1999—2008—present), Alexander «Gypsum» Bychkov — drums (2008, 2011—2008—present)."

  "details_block_1": "is a Swedish heavy metal band, formed by guitarist Jesper Strömblad in Gothenburg in 1990. Alongside At the Gates and Dark Tranquillity, In Flames pioneered the genres known as Swedish death metal and melodic death metal. During the band's early years, In Flames had a varying group of musicians recording with them, including many session musicians. By the release of Colony (1999) the group had established a stable lineup. Their sixth studio album Reroute to Remain (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style of music that moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to alternative metal. This decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales. As of 2008, In Flames has sold over two million records worldwide.",
